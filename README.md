# README, ML project 1 : Higgs boson classification
This is the submission for the machine learning project 1 : Higgs boson classification.
This project aims to identify higgs boson by analysing the decay signature measured after a collision between two atoms. More precisely, this is a classification task with two possible classes : Higgs boson or other particle.

For this project, we exclusively implemented and used simple models (linear models) such as the least square method, logistic regression or ridge regression. The data used is original CERN data.

## Installation
For this project, no external libraries were used except :
- Numpy, for calculus
- Matplotlib, for plotting


As such, no prior installation should be required.

## Structure
- *project1.ipynb* : Main notebook, contains the our progress throughout the project, inluding the data exploration, feature engineering and predictions,
- *implementations.py* : Contains the functions used in "project1.ipynb" such as the mandatory prediction function and feature engineering functions,
- *proj1_helpers.py* : Helper functions provided by the professor,
- *run.py* : The reproducible code of our best submission,
- *Report_Project_1_ML.pdf* : Our 2 pages pdf report.
